# solidarity
Resources for solidarity.

This respository is built to collect resources for MAPE members, but it's open to the public. With that in mind - don't include any private information here.

The majority of these pages will be written in Markdown, which is an easy way to add styling to text documents on the web without having to write in HTML. You can learn more about how to write in Markdown here: [Basic Markdown Syntax Explained](https://itsfoss.com/markdown-guide/). 

If you don't know how to use Markdown but want to contribute, cool! Just write in text, that's fine.
