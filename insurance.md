## Vision Insurance

Your insurance card for vision insurance says BlueCross BlueShield, but that is a lie. Our vision coverage is through Davis Vision, and when I created an account on the Blue Cross site listed on the card (bluecrossmn.com/segip-vision), I just kept getting errors. 

The Davis Vision website is here: [Davis Vision](http://www.davisvision.com)
You'll need the ID number on your BlueCross Vision ID card to create an account. 

**Notes:** 
- Once you've logged into the site and are in the Member Menu, clicking the 'Members' breadcrumb will take you back to the main page, and getting back requires another login.
- There is no benefit summary available on the site that lists our benefits (as of 2025-05-27). The phone agent was surprised by that. If you have spoons, it would be awesome for people to call/email SEGIP to find out how we can get a written summary of benefits.

###  Coverage Info
*This information came from a phone conversation with a Davis Vision rep on 2025-05-27. If you have updates please feel free to edit! Include sources.*

You can search for in-network providers on the Davis Vision website and it also has the forms to submit out of network reimbursement. They also cover online retailers like 1800contacts and Warby Parker, and apparently we have some LASIK coverage as well. Notably, HealthPartners eye clinics are out of network.

In-network coverage: 
- eye exam
- contact evaluation
- contacts are covered up to $150 and then at a 15% discount.
- glasses are covered up to $150 (private clinic), $200 (vision works) and have a $10 copay for lenses (single vision - maybe different cost for bifocals and trifocals, but I don't have those).
**You can get covered for glasses OR contacts, but not both in one year.**

Out of network coverage:
- No reimbursement for exams
- Flat fee reimbursement for contacts of $105
- Glasses are reimbursed $50 for frames and $40 for lenses
