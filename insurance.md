## Vision Insurance

Your insurance card for vision insurance says BlueCross BlueShield, but that is a lie. Our vision coverage is through Davis Vision, and when I created an account on the Blue Cross site listed on the card (bluecrossmn.com/segip-vision), I just kept getting errors. 

The Davis Vision website is here: [http://www.davisvision.com](Davis Vision)
