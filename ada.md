## Language for Accommodation Requests

The language below can be used to make accommodation requests, in either the forms that are required to be submitted or in the interactive meetings for review of the requests. These are examples that others have used; use as much or as little as is useful, or as a springboard for helping craft your own. (We'd love to have more examples, so feel free to share!)

Things to keep in mind:
- You do not need to disclose your specific disability, diagnosis, or private medical information, and you **should not** be asked to do so by the employer. You **may** disclose this information if you choose to.
- It's best to focus on the sympmtoms/issues that you are experiencing, and the accommodation you are requesting, and you can do so in very broad terms. Many conditions have similar symptoms that can be communicated with non-specific language that doesn't force you to share private information.

### What, if any, job function are you having difficulty performing?

Currently, none, because I am able to manage my disabilities as needed throughout the day. The new telework policy that requires 50% in-office time will mean that I am not able to work efficiently and effectively due to the way our offices are set up (large, open plan with short hotel cubes and conference rooms that leak noise), and will not have privacy to address my symptoms as they fluctuate throughout the day.

### What, if any, employment benefits are you having difficulty accessing?

Currently, none, because I am able to schedule and attend medical appointments on my break times, and have a private space to conduct them with minimal disruption to my work day. The new telework policy will require me to reschedule or cancel medical appointments, since there is no private space available in [my office building]. Many providers have limited availability, which means that needing to change scheduled appointments can result in weeks or months on a waitlist, and will negatively affect my ability to manage my disabilities.

### What limitation, as result of your physical or mental impairment, is interfering with your ability to perform your job or access an employment benefit?

Currently, none, because I have a private workspace that is set up to accommodate my ergonomic and health needs. The new telework policy will require me to work in large, open office spaces where I am unable to manage noise, light, visual distraction, and temperature, and where I do not have access to ergonomic equipment that is adjusted appropriately to my needs and work habits.

### If you are requesting a specific accommodation, how will that accommodation be effective in allowing you to perform the functions of your job?

This accommodation will allow me to continue working in a space that is designed around my needs and allows me to manage my disability in a way that ensures the least amount of disruption and negative effects on my work productivity, while still allowing me to collaborate regularly and effectively with my colleagues. It enables me to attend the medical appointments that are necessary to keep me healthy, and reduces the amount of time I need to take off to attend those appointments and the transition back to work during the day. Having privacy to manage my medical needs also ensures that I can participate fully in my team and my role, without needing to disclose private medical information or worry about judgment and micro-aggressions related to my condition. Overall, this accommodation allows me to be as healthy and effective as I can be, ensuring that I can meet the expectations of my role and reducing the amount of time and money spent on managing my symptoms.
